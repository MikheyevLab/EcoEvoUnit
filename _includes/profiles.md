I have broad interests in evolutionary biology, focusing mainly on leveraging the power of next-generation tools for answering long-standing basic questions. As a result, I like to explore new techniques, be they laboratory, computational, or involving new sequencing technologies. Although I started my career in the laboratory and in the field, presently I am more of a bioinformatician. Over the past couple of years, I became increasingly interested in applying short-read sequencing to degraded DNA, such as that found in museum, archaeological or other poorly preserved specimens. Having developed a range of tools for high-throughput processing of degraded insects, are harnessing these tools for projects ranging from ecosystem phylogenetics and phylogeography, to studying evolutionary processes using museum samples. Additionally, I maintain an interest in social insect systems, which I worked on during my graduate studies, and also nurture a more recently acquired research program using snake venoms to understand adaptation. In my spare time, I enjoy long runs, and playing the violin.

I have a long-time interest in molecular biology and genetics. Before joining the lab, I spent 5 years working on molecular genetics of castor bean. Now I am working as a research technician on ancient DNA, including ancient DNA extraction, sequencing and so on. So I have the chance to work with different precious samples such as museum samples; it is work requiring special care. In the meantime, I also help Misato with a project on the reproductive system of the ant *Vollenhovia emeryi*, which is really a new world for me. As a Chinese person, I enjoy the peaceful life and beautiful landscape here.
