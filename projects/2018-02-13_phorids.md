# Visualizing parasitization with microCT
## Rob and Sasha

![MicroCT of ant head]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/robsphorids.jpg "An unlicky _Solenopsis_ fire ant and its larval _Pseudacteon_ phorid fly parasitoid"){:width="300px"}{: .align-left} Phorid flies in the genus _Pseudacteon_ are specialized parasitoids of _Solenopsis_ fire ants. Female flies lay their eggs in the abdomens of fire ant workers. After hatching the larval parasitoid then travels to the head, where it feeds on mandibular muscle and changes the host antâ€™s behavior to keep itself safe. Little is known about the physical interactions between the parasitoid and its host. We are using microcomputed tomography (microCT) to visualize the development of larval phorid flies _in situ_.
