Ant worker traits are remarkable in that they evolve despite the fact that the workers themselves do not reproduce. As a part of our ongong collaboration with the [Linksvayer Lab](http://sites.sas.upenn.edu/linksvayer-lab), in a [recently published paper in eLife](http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e04775?_ga=1.25883067.769126097.1432248984) we showed that the evolution of genes involved in social behavior is constrained by the effects of gene co-expression networks. You can listen to a podcast where Tim Linksvayer describes this work [here](http://elifesciences.org/podcast/episode18).
