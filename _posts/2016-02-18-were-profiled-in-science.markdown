Our work was highlighted in a recent Technology Feature in [Science](http://www.sciencemag.org/custom-publishing/technology-features/hard-core-sequencing) called *Hardcore Sequencing*, which focused on working with difficult specimens. I had a great chat with Alan Dove, the feature's author, about our past and ongoing work, including a collaboration with CSIRO on the population genetics of the [Lord Howe stick insect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryococelus_australis), pictured above. It was believed to have gone extinct with the introduction of rats to Lord Howe Island in the early 20th century, but what appears to be a relic population was found on a nearby island. There is now an active conservation program, and a great little animated movie called [Sticky](https://vimeo.com/jillirose/wwwvimeocomsticky).

Alan also pointed me to another story the mysterious disappearance of the [Rocky Mountain locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_locust), which I would love to follow up.
