The worldwide spread of _Varroa destructor_ has had a massive impact on beekeeping, and the health of honey bees. _Varroa_ switched from the Eastern honey bee (_Apis cerana_) to the Western honey about a hundred years ago. However, we know very little about the evolutionary forces acting on _Varroa_ on its new hosts, and how it actually spread throughout the world. Taking advantage of a [genome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/937?genome_assembly_id=335323) we and our collaborators recently sequenced, and have already made available to the research community, we are collecting samples from around the world yo investigate these questions. The current grant will help with the massive sequencing effort this study requires.
