Over lunch during one of his visits to OIST, my former boss Sydney Brenner suggested that I try a ribo-tailing technique for attaching adaptors to short DNA molecules. The idea is that the action of terminal transferase on riboguanidines creates a 3&#8242; tail of controlled length, which can be used for attaching adaptors and synthesizing a second strand ([Komura and Riggs, 1998][1]; [Lee and Weeks, 2006][2]).We tried it, and it was amazing. This approach eventually produced a method that we use for working with degraded DNA, just published in [PLoS ONE][3] (and available in detail [here][4]). The PLoS ONE paper outlines this approach, at least an earlier version, and presents a fairly non-destructive way of extracting DNA form museum insects. Using this approach we could sequence RAD-tags from tiny 100 year old ants, and create a Hawaiian fruit fly phylogeny.
