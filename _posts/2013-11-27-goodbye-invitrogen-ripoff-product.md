With the help of Ken Meacham of the [Bandi Unit][1], we have successfully used some magnets to inexpensively 3D print our own magnetic stands based on [this design][2] and some inexpensive [magnets][3]. They look like cheap imitations, but just as well, if not better, and cost orders of magnitude less (last I checked the commercial stand in the background would set you back a cool [US$531][4]).
