It is our pleasure to welcome again in our unit, Dr. Darko Cotoras, a [research associate at the California Academy of Sciences](https://www.calacademy.org/staff/ibss/entomology/darko-d-cotoras), from September 4th to October 6th, 2019.

If you do not know about spiders or island biogeography principles and look for a passionate researcher to share with you about it, get ready if you meet Darko! If you happened to be in Okinawa, just come to lab 2 level C at OIST. Aside from being a Japanese karaoke enthusiast and enjoying the beautiful summer in Okinawa, Darko is with us to sequence and analyze some *Wendilgarda* spiders collected from his recent field trip in Costa Rica. He is aiming at better understanding the evolutionary history of the genus of spiders by performing a molecular phylogenetic reconstruction of this group.

We look forward to learning more about his results in a future talk (date and time to be communicated soon). 

Also *congratulations on his Humboldt Research Fellowship* which will lead him to Germany in a few months to keep studying spiders evolution.
