About a year after I started my lab, I was approached by Alejandro, who just started his JSPS postdoc. He was interested in looking at transcriptional networks during coral development. Although corals and development more generally were pretty much outside my field, I was intrigued by this collaboration. As it happens, we were just beginning to make transcriptional data sets, and I was excited to try a new system. Now, our work is finally published in [*Genome Biology and Evolution*](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/03/03/gbe.evw042.full.pdf). This was a fun project, resulting from collaboration with Ryukyu University and OIST.
