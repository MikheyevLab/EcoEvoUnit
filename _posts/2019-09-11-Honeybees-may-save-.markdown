We are highly excited to start a new research project in collaboration with Onna Village Office (where OIST is located). This collaboration is part of the Red Soil project from Onna Village and our own honeybee/microbiome/parasite research in the Mikheyev Unit. The connection may sound surprising at a first view: "bees save coral", but the intelligent idea of Onna Village office is to promote beekeeping in farmlands to grow diverse flowers, which would ultimately help to reduce red soil erosion in the sea threatening corals. You can read more on [this OIST article](https://www.oist.jp/news-center/news/2019/9/6/honeybees-help-save-okinawan-coral) nicely covered by Christopher Richarson.

Our research Unit offered to use ~15 of our Western honey bee colonies (*Apis mellifera* 西洋ミツバチ) to promote the Onna Village project and to foster closer interactions between OIST and Onna Village. More excitingly, our bee team and Onna village office want in joint effort establish the Japanese honey bee (*Apis cerana japonica* 日本のミツバチ) here in Okinawa for research purposes and beekeeping. With the great help of Onna Village we already received two Japanese bee colonies, which are the only ones on Okinawa so far. The Onna Village bee keepers are taking care of the Japanese honey bees and once the bees adapted to Okinawa they can start producing rare honey made from the Japanese honey bee who is only found in Japan. The profit from selling the honey will benefit the Red Soil project. Also educational tours to the honey bees showing e.g. the differences between the two species would be possible in future. Japanese bees are exceptional as they are the original host of the devastating parasite Varroa destructor (ミツバチヘギイタダニ) but can, in contrast to Western bees, defend themselves very well. They also show other extraordinary abilities such as heat-balling against hornets (スズメバチ.) Thanks to the Onna Village’s extensive work and effort in taking care of the colonies, we will also be able to tackle diverse important research questions regarding differences between Western and Japanese honey bee regarding microbiome and parasite adaptation.



===================
LONG POST TO FOLLOW FOR SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:

The by bee keepers commonly used Western honeybee Apis mellifera is very likely the most “famous” honey bee worldwide as it is used for honey production and pollination services. Though being the most famous and most widely spread honey bee today, the Western honey bee was originally only found in Europe, Africa and Middle East. In Asia interestingly a much higher diversity of honey bees exists and the Western honey bee is the only Apis bee that is non-native to Asia. Japan is the original home of the Japanese honey bee Apis cerana japonica which has traditionally been used in bee keeping before the Western honey bee was introduced. Nowadays most Japanese bee keepers also work with the Western honey bee as this species produces more honey.  
The Western honey bee and the Japanese honey bee are sister species that diverged from a common ancestor at least 6 million years ago. There are several profound differences in size, pollination behavior and nesting between the two species. 

While there is extensive research on the Western honey bee to increase productivity and health, the Japanese honey bee has scientifically been neglected. 
A better understanding could be specifically helpful in the current situation of worldwide collapsing honey bee populations.
When the Western honey bee was introduced worldwide for beekeeping, this was accompanied by problems. Every organism will carry pathogens and parasites which get spread in the new environments and to other species who have no defense against these diseases. The most famous and dramatic example here is the spread of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor from its original host the Japanese honey bee to the Western honey bee. The mite and specifically the transmitted viruses are fatal for Western honey bees and are thought to be the main reason for colony collapses. Varroa damages to Asian honeybee colonies are rare as the original host has co-evolved with its parasite over a long evolutionary scale and developed several strategies to fight the mite. Although most of the defense strategies by A. cerana are well known regarding behavior as they can easily been observed (e.g. a better hygienic behavior), the resistance mechanisms from a physiological, immune or microbial scale needs is not known. Studying the processes driving the co-evolution of both organisms is necessary to find solutions. For this it is highly beneficial to work with both; the new host but also the old host which serves as a natural successful model system of established resistance. In addition, differences in the natural microbiome which has been shown to be highly important for the health of honey bees has not been intensively explored in the Asian honey bee so far. Beneficial microorganisms as secret, internal, little helpers could be key in the difference responses of the two bee species towards different types of stress factors like parasites, pathogens and chemicals. 
Such “biological war strategies” between honey bees, beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms and parasites occurring at the microscopic level are a promising research avenue especially here in Japan where we can have access to both honey bee species.
