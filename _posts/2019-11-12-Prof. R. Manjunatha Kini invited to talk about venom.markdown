Find his abstract below:  
Venoms form the armory of several animals in prey capture and/or predator deterrence. They have evolved as cocktails of several toxins and induce various pharmacological effects in key systems. These toxins are thought as villains as they cause death and debilitation. In reality, they have contributed more to improving our lives than cause death. Toxins have played crucial roles in the discovery and development of therapeutic and diagnostic agents for human diseases. They have also contributed as important research tools and helped us to understand molecular mechanisms of normal physiological processes such as neurotransmission, blood coagulation and platelet aggregation. Our lab in NUS has been studying structure-function relationships and mechanism of actions of novel toxins from various sources. Our research has contributed to both basic and applied sciences. Based on the functional sites of the toxins, we have developed several therapeutic agents for various human diseases. This talk will provide an overview of toxin research and the distinct dimension of both basic and applied research in the field.
