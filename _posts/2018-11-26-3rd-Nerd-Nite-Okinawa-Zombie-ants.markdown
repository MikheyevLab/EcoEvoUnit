![3rd edition Nerd Nite Okinawa]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Rob-nerdnite.jpg){:width="600px"}{: .align-left} If you are in Okinawa and interested in a relax and fun way to hear about scientific research while drinking beer or cocktails with friends and colleagues, go to Nerd Nite Okinawa! And guess what? The 3rd edition coming next Friday 7th December will feature our own Ph.D student Rob Campbell who will talk about Zombie Ants :ant:

Here is a short summary: "The Walking Dead meets Michael Crichton’s novel Prey -- these aren’t reanimated corpses or nanotech machines but real living parasites with the power to mind-control their hosts. No insect is safe-- or are they? What are these parasites and how do they take control? They already walk among us, hidden in plain sight; can we see what’s going on inside their hosts?""

Don't miss out the opportunity to see this excellent talk and learn about the mysterious phorid fly!


Nerd Nite initiative in Okinawa has been greatly appreaciated by a wide audience since the 1st edition last October, thanks to the amazing organization of Margaret Brisbin! You may have seen our first participation with a talk on bees and the terrible mite followed by curious questions and nice exchanges. Don't hesitate to become a volunteer speaker or follow the event @nerdniteoki
