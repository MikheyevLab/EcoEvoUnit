Last fall our intern Jigyasa Arora and I developed a teaching module that uses experimental evolution and next-generation sequencing to teach lab skills and bioinformatics. It is based on [Paul Hyman's lab](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3895413) (Ashland University), which uses the evolution of resistance by the bacterium *Escerichia coli* to the T5 bacteriophage to explore tha nature of coevolution and resistance. We modified the lab to include a next-generation sequencing and analysis component, which works spectacularly well. The teaching module and ssociated materials are now available as a [PeerJ preprint](https://peerj.com/manuscripts/6635/). Reviewers  requested that we provide a teaching assessment for this module to pass muster as a peer-reviewed teaching tool, so I hope carry out such an assessment with this fall's batch of students. 

If you want to give this lab a try in your own class, don't hesitate to contact me with questions.
