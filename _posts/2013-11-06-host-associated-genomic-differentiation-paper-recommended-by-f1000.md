It was a long, hard road, but our [paper][1] is getting some recognition! F1000&#8242;s Dr. Ian Wang [writes][2] that &#8220;this finding highlights the importance of considering multiple factors, including dispersal, population sizes, spatial variation in ecologically-important traits, and population histories, for understanding how ecological adaptation contributes to patterns of differentiation throughout the genome.&#8221;

I hope we the next phase of the study, [taking it next-generation][3] is as successful.
