In our lab we believe that data reproducibility and free availability is crucial. As a result, we are trying to disseminate our research results using a variety of available interactive tools such as R, markdown but also through repositories such as GitHub, Dryad and Bioxviv.

Below we have listed some these available resources:


## Honey bee and parasite/pathogens evolution
### World distribution of Varroa mites haplogroup
This work is part of the [preprint Varroa review](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0374/v1). The aim of this map is to keep complete these maps with novel records over time on the invasion progress of Varroa mites worldwide. Do not hesitate to raise your voice if you would like to participate, correct or suggest any modificiations.

World distribution maps are available [here](https://mikheyevlab.github.io/varroa-mtDNA-world-distrib/)

### Status of the World Varroa mite collection
Since 2016, we have gathered preserved specimens of Varroa mites thanks to collaborators and beekeepers all over the world. The genomes of these samples will be or are being sequenced to retrace the invasion pathways and understand the evolution of Varroa mites on their new hosts following host switch and global spread.

World distribution of samples in the collection are available [here](https://mikheyevlab.github.io/varroa-map/)


## Snake Venom Evolution
Online supplemental information including code, data, original figures, and additional analysis with 25 toxin classes from [Agneesh Barua's paper](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/9/1964/5492084#163586587), (PhD student).
